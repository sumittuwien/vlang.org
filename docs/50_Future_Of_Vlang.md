## Future of Vlang in Connection to D

Vlang has not been developed as an extension library of D language and not a compiler due to some valid reasons. For a compiler to be built from scratch there is a need of defining syntax and hence there are always chances of defining broken and bad syntax. Instead, Vlang chooses it's base language as D to take advantage of:

1. Modern compiler technology of D which makes D codes compile and simulate lightning fast.
2. The dynamic and adventerous nature of development trend of D which makes many features available for Vlang in future.
3. The D development community have an immense trust on user intelligence and hence in order to provide a language feature, the development community does not do strict use case analysis. This is extremely useful for Vlang to perform continuous experiment and improvements.
4. D has rich set of generic programming capabilities which is extremely useful for writing generic models using Vlang.
5. D promises to provide AST macros in future which can be use as base for language development. This feature is incredible for Vlang as with this feature Vlang can perform miracles. The user of Vlang also can take advantage of this feature for defining their own custom syntax.

## Future of Vlang

The future of Vlang depends on following factors:

1. Future development of D.
2. R&D efforts on Vlang so that Vlang can incorporate novel methodologies and features.
3. User base which regularly reports issues they face with Vlang so that problems can be rectified and features can be added.
4. Vlang plans to add capabilities and features for analog mixed-signal verification (for SystemC-AMS, Verilog-AMS and VHDL-AMS). SystemC-AMS being open source, will be the first candidate which will be picked up.
5. Vlang plans to add capabilities and features for Requirements written in SysML and UML.

## Standardization of Vlang

As a measure to provide reliability, backward compatibility and universal acceptability, Vlang wishes to go through standardization procedures in near future.
