# Vlang Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. ### Vlang is free! still do I need to share my source code ?
No! The core part of Vlang which is known as ESDL is distributed under Boost Software License and the UVM part of Vlang is distributed under Apache 2.0 License. Both licenses does not make sharing of the source code mandatory with the recipient.

1. ### How much D language I need to learn to use Vlang ?
Yes! Vlang is based on D and hence familiarity with D syntax will make efficient use of Vlang. Better the skill in D effciency of the code will be better.

1. ### What are the problems with existing verification languages ?
Existing verification languages are:

 * Heavy, high in number of language constructs out of which few minimal subsets are used.
 * Incomplete object orientation which leads to a hardware like test bench abstraction, whereas software like test bench abstraction is needed.
 * No template meta-programming and C++11 equivalent template abstraction and hence:
   >* Hard to write generic model
   >* No standard libraries
 * Extremely high compilation and elaboration time.
 * Not concurrent and hence does not allow to take advantages from modern multiprocessor/multi-threaded  system. This also prevents the scaling up of existing reusable models.
